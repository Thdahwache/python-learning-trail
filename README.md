# python-learning-trail

 This repository is for programs that i developed during my python learning trajectory. You will find mostly programs made during the 100 Days of Course, from Dr. Angela Yu, and they may have, or may not, many traces of my learning trail, as sometimes i just wanted to test things, like on the Rock, Paper and Scissors game.


 ### Password generator

 A simple program to generate a password with the conditions specified by the user, as how many letters, number and symbols they want. After choosing the quantities, the program will pick and randomize the characters to return a password for you.

 ### Hangman game

 The famous Hangman Game made with Python and a portuguese dictionary from Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME). To properly execute this script you will need the forca.py and dic_pt-br.txt. The choosen word will be printed at the beggining of the script, so you can use the program even if you don't know portuguese.

 ### Rocks, Papers and Scissors

 Also know as jokenpo, this program is a competition between machine and man, as the computer will choose a random symbol and check if it wins or lose, printing the results. This one was made for training of everything that i had see at the moment.
